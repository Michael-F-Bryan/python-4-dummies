# Files and Strings and Stuff

Some of the most fundamental parts of programming are working with text and
understanding how to do basic operations on files.

This will be done by implementing several basic GNU core utilities as Python
scripts. By the end of this section, you should hopefully have written your own
implementation of:

- `cat`
- `grep` (for simple string searches)
- `wc`

When implementing things, you'll probably want to ask yourself:

- What is the purpose of this tool (hint, check the `man` pages)?
- In English, what do we want the computer to do?
- If you encounter something you don't understand, what key words can you plug
  into Google to help find a solution?
